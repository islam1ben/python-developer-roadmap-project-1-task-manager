first python project : task manager 
project url :https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

this is my first serious project in python and since i am a beginner there are somethings that i encountred here for the first time,
like git and github ,branches and json files...
you might find it unorganized and a lil bit messy so i just wanted to let you know this 
in the beginning of the project i didn't quite understand the whole project requirements and goals so i added a lot of unnecessary stuff and removed them later 
i am now very satisfied with what i ended up with so any feedback will be very helpfull 
i would also be grateful if you provide me with a version made by a professional developer to see how would they handle a project
